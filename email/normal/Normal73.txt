Dear Hill,

Javier had sent you the requested materials on 8/15 (see attached email)
and I sent you the hard copy by FEDEX (from Pfizer on the same day) and
I wonder whether you had any problem receiving it. To be on the safe
side, I will resend you the hard copy.

Could you send me a note back whenever you receive this?
Regards.
