Dear Colleagues and Staff Members,

I will join NSF through the govenment "on loan" program for a year,  
which is extensible to a maximum of three years.
I'd like to thank everyone for the support over the years.

To minimize the impact of this move on my graduate students, I will come 
back frequently, hopefully every Friday, to continue supervising my PhD 
and MS students.

Jie
