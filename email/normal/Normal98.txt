Dr. Zhu,

I am a FEEDS student in your Neural Network class.

I think the answer to the question regarding the maximum number of unique 
decision trees we can possible build is infinite because that number will 
vary depending on the technique used, the thresholds used to split nodes, 
the number of significant attributes, and the type of attributes.
