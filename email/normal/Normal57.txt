Dear Dr. Zhu,

Sorry to disturb you. This is just a reminding letter. As a PC member, you can find in the Microsoft Review System some papers appear with labels like "accept as full", "accept as poster", "reject" or "discussion", these were initial recommendations made by area chairs, which may be changed by PC chairs or the area chairs themselves, and are not the final decisions.

Any problems please contact us.


Sincerely Yours,
Zhi-Hua Zhou, Hang Li, Qiang Yang
