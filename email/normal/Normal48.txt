Dear CSE Faculty,

This is to remind you that the request for instructional equipment is
due Jan 8, 2007.

Note: You may have received a forwarded message including a message I sent
earlier to this effect. It was not meant to be sent in that format. 
I hit return too soon before I got a chance to edit it. Sorry for the mess.

Happy New Year.

Sam Hsu
