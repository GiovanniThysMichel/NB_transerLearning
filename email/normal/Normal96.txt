Dear CSE students and faculty,

I am teaching COP3813 this semester and require that each student to design
a simple ecommerce website to sell whatever they want online. As an
important part of the requirement, their website should allow customers to
use "shopping cart", collect customers' selection from different web pages
and submit the orders to the server (pluto) for further process (database
access). This is considered to be very close to websites like Amazon.com.

Some of the students really did excellent job. I am sharing with you several
good designs here. Hope you will like them.
B.T.W. please contact the authors directly if you were ineresting in buying
any items from their websites... :-)

Enjoy your winter break.

Hill
