Hey,
 I had a few quetsions. You may remember how my test was blank at the 
end because I was using wordpad. I was just wondering if there is any 
extra credit I can do to make up for that. I saw that you said the 
group project has extra credit if you can do it by yourself so I will 
do that. If I use MySQL for my term project would that also give me 
more extra credit? Thanks for the quick responses. Let me know if there 
is any other makeup available
