Hi, Everyone,

I have finished the grading of homework 1. If you submitted your 
homework 
through the email, you should have received the results already.
If you submitted a hard copy, you can either stop by my office today or 
pick 
it up in the class room.

I will post the solution online later this afternoon.

(Please add "CAP5615" to the subject field of all your emails)

Thanks

Hill
