Dr. Zhu,

You asked if the information gain due to an attribute could be negative.  I 
looked at entropy which is between 0 1and 1. Where 0 means there no 
randomness and no entropy to 1 when it is totally random.

The information can never go negative.  If you take the extreme case of no 
randomness where their is no randomness then the system entropy is 1.  The 
information gain for the attribute that tells you the answer is also That is 
because the log to the base two of 1 is zero.

For the other extreme you have the attribute entopy is 0 times infinity 
which is zero. The information gain is the system entropy.

To sum it up the information gain has to be a number between 0 and 1.
