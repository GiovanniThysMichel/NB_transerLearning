Hi Xingquan,
I am just now back in Florida. I have these from last year, but I need to 
update them.
I will try doing that today. FYI, I will be using blackboard for my class so 
they can get these from the blackboard once it is set up.

Also, I need to ask you for a quick summary of the things you covered last 
week.

Thanks for filling me in.
Best regards,
Daniel
