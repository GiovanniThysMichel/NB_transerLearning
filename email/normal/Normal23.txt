If you are receiving this message, it is because, according to my records, you have not previously attended one of the Customer Services Classes offered by our College.

It was the Dean’s choice to not make these classes mandatory.  However, he was very hopeful that the majority of COE&CS employees would choose to participate.  

 

If it was your decision to not go because you don’t need to learn anything new about customer service, then you may be someone who has much to offer others about customer service.  The exchange of ideas is one of the highlights of the classes.

 

The dates, times, and locations for the February classes are as follows:

 

Thursday, February 15, 8:30 – 11:30 a.m., Boca Campus, Board of Trustees Room, ADM 305

Friday, February 16, 1:00  – 4:00 p.m., SeaTech, Auditorium

 

A light breakfast of breads, fruits, juices and coffee will be served at the Boca class.  Cookies, fruits, sodas, and coffee will be served at the SeaTech class.
