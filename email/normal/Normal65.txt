Dear CSE faculty,

It is my pleasure to inform you that four students received this year's
Lifelong Learning Scholarship awards, three of them are from CSE.

  Yongsuk Lee
  Ulysse Louigne
  Tho Thuc HA

I would like to express my appreciation to those faculty who have encouraged 
our CSE students to apply and written recommendation letters for them.

Thanks.

Sam Hsu
