Unlike in bioinformatics where the focus is on the biology within a cell in living organisms, the focus of health informatics is on human tissues, organs and specific medical conditions. It is concerned with patients' medical records and clinical data. Moreoever, one of the key directions of medical research for the next decade is personalized medicine. This is partly made feasible by recent advances of high throughput biotechnologies, such as comparative genome hybridization arrays, microarrays and mass spectrometry for proteomics and metabolomics.

In this special issue of SIGKDD Explorations, we solicit papers on health informatics research which requires mining of large amounts of data - clinical, DNA copy number, gene expression, protein expression and/or metabolonomics data. The following is a non-exhaustive list of possible topics:

- feature selection for biomarker identification
- cross-platform combinatorial mining of genomics features
- mining transcription factor binding sites
- prediction models of tumor/disease development
- correlation mining of clinic data and genomic data
- mining proteomics and/or metabolomics data
- data mining for personalized medicine
- modeling signalling networks
- temporal and spatial mining of clinic data including medical images

Each paper must dedicate a significant portion of the paper (e.g., no less than 25%) describing the health problem being studied. And in light of the 2003 SIGKDD Explorations special issue on microarray data mining, papers which focus solely on microarray data should include new developments since 2003.

Schedule
