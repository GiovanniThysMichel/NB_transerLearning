Hi Hill,

   Please find the ICDM paper from the following link:


You could highlight the places where you revise on an electronic  
version. Or you could print it out, make revisions, scan them into  
computers, and send them to me. I also put the finalVersion.tex in the  
same folder, you could work on it too. Thanks a lot!
