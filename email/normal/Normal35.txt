Dear Dr. Xingquan Zhu,

The conference submission deadline for the IASTED International Conference on Computational Intelligence (CI 2007)  is quickly approaching. We would appreciate your assistance in reminding colleagues that the submission deadline for CI 2007 is February 1, 2007. I have also enclosed the most recent Call for Papers (in .pdf) which can be distributed to mailing lists and interested colleagues.  I would also invite you to share your expertise by planning a tutorial or organizing a special session regarding your current research.  

More information is available on the web site at:

Thank you for your continued support!
