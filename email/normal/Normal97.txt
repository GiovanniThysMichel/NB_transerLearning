Dear Dr. Xingquan Zhu:
 
I have registered for your class for Introduction of Neural Network for Spring 2007.
 
As you had asked us to inform you through mail about this.
 
Actually, I have got Research Assistanceship and I will have to go to Motorola to work, I won't be able to attend your classes on Mondays and Wednesdays.
I have registered for Feeds and view your classes on the DVDs.
 
I will approach to you in case I have any doubts regarding any topics.
