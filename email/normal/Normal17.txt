Dear Hill,

I was wondering if I get a copy of the book 

Xingquan Zhu and Ian Davidson, Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining: Challenges and Realities with Real World Data, IDEA Group Inc. Publisher

from the publisher. I never received any notification nor any other information.

Kind regards, Petra
