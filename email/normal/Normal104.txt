Hill,

A quick "numerical analysis" type question when implementing the 
classifier:

The product of probabilities quickly vanish to zero if I used the 
formula from the slides for Naieve Bayes.  Is there some way of 
expressing this product either as a recurrence (as in the Birthday 
Problem) or in a logarithmically scaled form?
