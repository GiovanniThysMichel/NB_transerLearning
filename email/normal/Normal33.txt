Dear Mr. Zhu,

I'm Victor M. Gulias, a lecturer at University of Coruña (Spain), head
of a group working in distributed systems; we use multimedia servers as
interesting case study.

Looking for information on video processing techniques, I have found a
paper of you describing the InsightVideo system. I was wondering if you
can tell me a little bit about it and related work; It would be nice to
start productive collaboration, if you consider it possible.

Best Regards,
