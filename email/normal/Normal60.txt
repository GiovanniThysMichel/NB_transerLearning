Dear Xingquan, 
 
Thank you for accepting our invitation to serve on the KDD-07 Program 
Committee. 
 
Would you please let Mary Crissey (KDD-07 Publicity Chair,

send you some nice KDD-07 posters for you to advertise the conference? 
You can reply to this message with your postal address, and your reply 
will be directed to Mary directly. 
 
Thanks, 
 
Xindong and Rich
