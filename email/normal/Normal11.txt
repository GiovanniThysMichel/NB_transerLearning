Dear Yong Suk Lee,

Attached is your Payroll Remittance Advice. The password to open the 
file includes the first 4 characters of your last name plus the last 4 
digits of your Social Security Number. Please note that your password 
is case sensitive. Normally, only the first character should be in caps 
and everything else is lower case. However, if your last name is 
spelled with multiple upper case letters, or if it has any special 
characters or spaces, these characters or spaces will be part of your 
password. If for example your last name is Mc Donald, and your social 
security number is 123 45 6789, your password will be Mc D6789 (the 
space will be one of the four characters).

If your last name is less than four characters long, use your full 
name, followed by X's (in caps) to come up with the four characters 
plus the last four digits of your social security number. For example, 
if your last name is Li and your social security number is 123-45-6789, 
your password is LiXX6789.
