NOTE:  There has been a break in the City's water main on Glades Rd. that is effecting the Boca Campus.  The City has reduced it's pressure by about 40% until which time they can fix the break.  It is our undertanding that the City, if it cannot complete the fix by 3:00 a.m.Tuesday they may need to do a complete water shut-down of the campus in order to make the necessary repairs.  We will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as the situation changes. 

In addition, the City road widening of Spanish River is ongoing.  The City's contractor has temporarily closed the northbound lane of FAU Blvd. at Spanish River.  The City's contractor has indicated will be completed by 3:00 pm today.  You may want to consider an alternate route when leaving the campus today.
