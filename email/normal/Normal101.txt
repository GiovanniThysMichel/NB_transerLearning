Dr. Zhu, Ms. Gault -

I am a feeds student and tried to pick up my Lecture 2
CD for CAP 5615 (Intro to Neural Networks) last Friday
(1/19/2007) and was told that they were out.

Is there any way I can get a copy of this lecture
ASAP?

I'll stop by again tomorrow morning to check if it is
available.
