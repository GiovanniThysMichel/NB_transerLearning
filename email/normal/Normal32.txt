Folks,
 The Z: Drive issue still persists and we are working with IRM to trace down
the problem. We do not have an ETA as of yet but the is a good chance that
the problem will not be resolved until the weekend. We will be trying some
options with IRM over the afternoon and I will provide an update around 3
PM.
 
The problem appears to be related to some recent changes to the FAU Servers
along with some recent Microsoft patches.
