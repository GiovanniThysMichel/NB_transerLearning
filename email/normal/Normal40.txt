It's a bit confusing what you wrote. As for a density function, if you put X to be a two dimensional random variable, say it has x1 and x2 indepedent. The joint density is still f(x1, x2)=f(x1)f(x2), you can't have something in the exponent with a 2-dimensional random variable but the covariance is one dimensional, meaning only with \sigma^2. Anyway you probably just omit those in the one page you sent to me.
