Hello All, 

We will have a Distinguished Lecture on Thursday February 8, 2007, at 11am in Administration Building Room 305. The lecture will be given by Dr. Nataraj Nagaratnam, a Chief Architecture for Identity Management at IBM. I think it woud be a good opportunity for you all to see what the state-of-the-art of research and practice is in industry. So we will have our tomorrow's class over Administration Buiding Room 305. See you all there. -- Dr. S. Huang
