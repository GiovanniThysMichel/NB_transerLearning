Dear Dr. Zhu

I wanted to ask you if you are considering me for your research 
assistantship position on the bioinformatics and data mining project. I 
am flying home next week for the Christmas break, and I would like to 
use this time wisely to fill in the background gaps that I might have 
to start working very promptly at the beginning of next semester.

Thank you,
