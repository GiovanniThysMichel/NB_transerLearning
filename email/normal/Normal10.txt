Hi Anish,

I have sent a more detail E-mail about the problem that we had today.
The problem was actaully not too serious. I was improperly handling
null values in the stored procedures. 

The more serious problem is the 'null' value and what seems to be 
corrupted data in the RadioSW column. Because this will effect the Web 
interface. We can probably find a way of handling it in the web 
interface. But we will need to find out the cause of it in the first 
place.

My theory is that the raw log for the new testids were from ADTE 
version that is not truely compatible with the new parser.

Anyway I do not think there is a need for you to come in on Monday.

So Enjoy the rest of Your Vacation!

Thanks,
Pateep
