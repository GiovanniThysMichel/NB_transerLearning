Dear Faculty,

I am planning to organize the second faculty meeting of the term on Friday April 6, 11:30AM-1:00PM. Dean Stevens has agreed to make it a lunch meeting, again, because the cost of catering is worth faculty participation. I understand that some of the cost is out of the Dean’s pocket so “thank you, Karl.” 

The reason for this email is 

To solicit agenda items from you. If you have any college or university related matter you would like to get a faculty discussion on or would like to hear the view from the Dean’s office, please let me know. If you wish to submit a question but do not want your name revealed, I promise to abide by your wish. (Of course you have to trust meJ ). Email me, call me or stop by my office to talk to me. 
To ask you to let Colleen Glazer glazer@fau.edu know if you will not be able to attend the meeting.  
 

Thank you very much.

 

Collegially yours,

Nurgun Erdol
