Dear Dr. Zhu,

Glad to hear from you. I really appreciate your endeavors to help me. 
Although the results are not so optimistic, I still do not want to miss any 
chance of doing the research I like under your supervision. Any way, I will 
submit my application materials as soon as possible according to your 
directions.

Thank you again for all you have done for me!
