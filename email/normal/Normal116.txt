ICWE invites proposals for tutorials that will provide conference participants with the opportunity to gain knowledge and insights in a broad range of Web engineering areas. Participants at the tutorials include researchers, scientists and practitioners who are seeking to gain a better understanding of the technologies, methodologies, tools, and techniques used to develop and maintain Web-based applications. A one-page summary of the accepted tutorials will be included in the conference proceedings.

Proposed tutorials can be either 1.5 or 3 hours long. Tutorials should address issues related to the topics of the conference. Topics not mentioned in the general conference list are also encouraged as long as they are of special interest and relevance to ICWE.
