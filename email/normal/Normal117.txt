Conference background and goals

 

The First European Conference on Data Mining (ECDM’07) is aimed to gather researchers and application developers from a wide range of data mining related areas such as statistics, computational intelligence, pattern recognition, databases and visualization. ECDM’07 is aimed to advance the state of the art in data mining field and its various real world applications. ECDM’07 will provide opportunities for technical collaboration among data mining and machine learning researchers around the globe. Main tracks have been identified (see below). However innovative contributions that do not fit into these areas will also be considered since they might be of benefit to conference attendees.
