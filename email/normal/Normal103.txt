Hi, Everyone,

The students of CAP5615 (Intro. to Neural Networks) are practising a spam 
filtering approach, which needs a large number of email samples.
While spam emails are pretty easy to find, we found that building a 
representative nonspam email sample set is difficult, due to reasons such as 
privacy.

We thus ask for your kind assistance in helping us build this sample set. We 
would greatly appreciate it if you can forward us (xqzhu@cse.fau.edu) one or 
two non-spam emails from your regular email box (those with minimal privacy 
concerns).

Requirement:

Any email which is not a spam email will do, however, we prefer the ones 
with more than 50 words.


Thank you very much.

Best,

Hill
