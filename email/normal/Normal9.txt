Pateep & Jason,

The RALPToDB tool will populate the two new fields in the DB. Based on
our earlier discussion I was going to supply you with the TestIDs once
all of the data was processed and populated in the DB. But since you
have made changes to support report-generation based on TransactionID
alone the only point that needs to be cleared/resolved is 'when' will
Jason call your SDs. Since I generate a report
(report_<TransactionID>.txt) file on completion of my processing, that
would be a good indication that the data is in the DB.

Regards,
Anish
