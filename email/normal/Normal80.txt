Dear all,

I should share a very exciting news with you. FAU has become a member of 
a large LA (Latin America) Grid project launched by IBM in December 2005 
(See a brief description below). Originally, IBM teamed up with five 
universities (see below), however FAU has been recently added into this 
elite group. This is a great opportunity for the FAU researchers.

Dr. Lemanski, Mohammad and I will be attending in the beginning of 
October the LA Grid Conference in Barcelona. We will present FAU 
research interests in this area. For this presentation, we will need 
from faculty whose research may need grid capabilities a brief 
PowerPoint description of their research. We would appreciate if you 
prepare 2 slides, one with bullets and one with a nice picture 
describing your current and/or potential research activities, which will 
need grid computing. Include your name and eventually graduate students 
involved. Attached is the PowerPoint design template.

Please, submit your contribution by *Monday, September 18*, so we can 
include it in our presentation.

Thanks.

Borko
