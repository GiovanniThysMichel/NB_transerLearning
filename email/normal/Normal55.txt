Dear authors of ICDE accepted paper 1003,

thank you for sending me a new PDF version of your paper. Unfortunately, 
the new version has failed the IEEE format-compliance test conducted by 
my assistants.

I believe the problem is with the IEEE format-compliance checker. To 
help us resolve this problem with the IEEE support team, could you send 
me by email
two things before 11:59pm PST on Friday December 15, 2006:

(1) the IEEE-checker receipt showing that your file has successfully 
passed the test, and

(2) the account name that you used to do the IEEE format-compliance 
checking; I believe that the name of the author doing the checking is 
enough.


Many thanks for your help and best regards,

Rada Chirkova
